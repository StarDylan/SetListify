# SongStackify
## Project Proposal
Our project, SetListify, will allow users to create playlists, share playlist with other users of their choice, and fork playlists from other users.

The system collects crowd-sourced song information

Users can play songs in a playlist and skip forwards or backwards, shuffle, and repeat.

When users stop playing songs from a playlist, the system will allow users to pick up from where they left off.
