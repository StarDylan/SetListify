# SongStackify™ - Redefining Music Playlists
## Project Proposal
SongStackify™ is the cutting-edge, cross-platform music player that empowers users to create and share personalized playlists effortlessly and seamlessly.

Leveraging crowd-sourced song information, users can add to and explore an extensive music library, and take part in the vibrant music community, amplifying their overall music exploration journey. 

Our mission is to revolutionize music streaming by prioritizing open-source development, ensuring transparency and community-driven innovation. With a strong emphasis on user privacy, we aim to foster a dynamic and interconnected community for music enthusiasts worldwide, guaranteeing a secure and personalized music experience.

At SongStackify™, we utilize advanced technology, specifically the LLaMA model, to predict users' moods. This innovative feature enables us to personalize advertising while ensuring complete user anonymity. SongStackify™ thus establishes an advertising platform that offers valuable insights to advertisers without compromising individual privacy, paving the way for mutually beneficial targeted advertising.
